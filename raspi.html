  <h1>Building a Portable Virtualization &amp; Security Lab with Raspberry Pi and VMware ESXi</h1>
<h5>By: Kian Ranjbar</h5>

  <p>
    I built a small, portable virtualization and security lab using a Raspberry Pi running VMware ESXi.
    The goal was to create a hands-on environment where I could experiment with Linux, virtualization,
    networking, and cybersecurity concepts in a controlled setting.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>
    The foundation of this project was a Raspberry Pi configured to run VMware ESXi, effectively turning
    it into a lightweight, portable virtual machine hub. This setup allowed me to deploy and manage
    multiple virtual machines for learning, testing, and experimentation—essentially a compact home lab
    that could be accessed remotely.
  </p>

  <h2>Linux &amp; Virtualization Experience</h2>

  <p>
    Through this project, I became comfortable working with multiple Linux distributions, with a strong
    focus on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)</strong> – My favorite overall due to its simplicity, stability,
      and ease of use.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kali Linux</strong> – Particularly valuable for its preinstalled offensive and defensive
      security tools.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Running these systems as virtual machines helped solidify my understanding of Linux internals,
    package management, system services, and remote access.
  </p>

  <h2>Security Tools &amp; Networking Concepts</h2>

  <p>
    I used this lab to explore practical cybersecurity tools and techniques, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wireshark for network traffic monitoring and analysis</li>
    <li>Nmap for reconnaissance and penetration testing</li>
    <li>Nessus for vulnerability scanning</li>
    <li>VPNs and Tor for understanding anonymity and IP obfuscation</li>
    <li>ProxyChains to route traffic through multiple proxies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All testing was conducted in an isolated, ethical environment designed strictly for learning and
    experimentation.
  </p>

  <h2>System Hardening &amp; Defensive Security</h2>

  <p>
    Beyond offensive tools, I focused heavily on system hardening and defensive practices:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>SSH hardening (key-based authentication and non-standard ports)</li>
    <li>PGP key usage for secure communication</li>
    <li>Firewall configuration using UFW</li>
    <li>Simulated DDoS scenarios to understand system behavior under stress</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These exercises helped me better understand attack surfaces and the importance of layered security.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Development &amp; Backend Experimentation</h2>

  <p>
    I also used the lab to experiment with classic, bare-metal web development:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Built a simple car rental database interface using PHP</li>
    <li>Designed and managed the backend with MySQL</li>
    <li>Deployed the application using Apache as the web server</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This reinforced full-stack fundamentals and demonstrated how application-level decisions interact
    with system-level security.
  </p>

  <h2>Remote Access &amp; Usability</h2>

  <p>
    One of the most valuable aspects of the project was remote accessibility:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Secure SSH tunneling into the Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>VNC-based remote desktop access to virtual machine frontends</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Being able to securely manage and interact with the lab from anywhere significantly enhanced its
    practicality and reinforced real-world administration skills.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Solidified Linux administration skills</li>
    <li>Gained practical experience with virtualization on limited hardware</li>
    <li>Applied cybersecurity concepts in a realistic environment</li>
    <li>Practiced web development, software testing, and ethical hacking fundamentals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Overall, this Raspberry Pi ESXi lab became a versatile learning platform and one of the most
    effective ways I’ve found to bridge theory with real-world technical execution.
