  <p>
The <strong>National Space Intelligence Center (NSIC)</strong> is the U.S. Space Force’s
    primary space intelligence organization. NSIC is designated as
    <strong>Space Delta 18</strong> and serves as the Space Force’s dedicated intelligence
    service center. NSIC is responsible
    for producing space-related intelligence that supports national security, military
    operations, and strategic decision-making.

<h2>What is The Data Mine (DMR) of the Rockies?</h2>

    <img src="images/nsic/TDM.png" alt="">
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>The Data Mine of the Rockies (DMR)</strong> is a collaborative data science initiative
    designed to bridge academia, industry, and government by training college students through
    hands-on, real-world data projects. Modeled after Purdue University’s nationally recognized
    Data Mine and founded in partnership with <strong>Purdue University</strong> and the
    <strong>University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS)</strong>, DMR connects students from
    all majors with defense, aerospace, technology, and other industry partners to solve
    high-impact problems, build practical skills, and develop a workforce prepared for careers
    in data science, AI, and analytics.
  </p>
                            
                            <hr>

                            
      <p>
      At the beginning of 2026, I joined a research project through <strong>The Data Mine of the Rockies (TDM)</strong>,
      where I am being deployed to work directly with the <strong>National Space Intelligence Center (NSIC)</strong>.
      The project—<strong>Project Shoelace</strong>—focuses on detecting disruptions and anomalies in GPS and broader
      GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      GPS is arguably the most monitored signal in the world. It is also one of the U.S. Space Force’s most expensive
      and complex space systems. From military operations to commercial aviation to everyday navigation apps,
      disruptions to GPS signals can have cascading real-world consequences.
    </p>
      
      
         <h2>The Problem: GPS Signal Anomalies</h2>
    <p>
      GPS and GNSS signals are consumed by a vast global network of sensors and receivers. These systems rely on GPS
      for <strong>position, navigation, and timing (PNT)</strong>. When signals are degraded—whether due to interference,
      jamming, spoofing, atmospheric effects, or hardware issues—the downstream impact can be severe.
    </p>
                            
     
    <p>
      NSIC’s goal is to leverage these global sensor networks to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify anomalous or degraded GPS/GNSS signals</li>
      <li>Detect emerging disruptions as early as possible</li>
      <li>Provide warnings to operators and end users</li>
    </ul>
      
          <p>
      The challenge is scale and complexity: massive data volume, many geographic locations, different formats,
      varying sample rates, and inconsistent signal fidelity.
    </p>

      
      
      <h2>What I’ll Be Working On</h2>
    <p>
      My role on Project Shoelace sits at the intersection of data engineering, signal analysis, and applied AI.
      Practically, my work can be summarized into a few core areas:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Working with High-Fidelity GPS Data</h3>
    <p>
      I will be analyzing data originating from extremely high-grade, proprietary satellite and sensor systems.
      Much of this data is represented through metrics like <code>Carrier-to-Noise Density Ratio (C/N₀)</code>,
      a key indicator of signal quality.
    </p>
                            
                                      <figure class="blog-figure">
    <img src="images/nsic/gnss.png" alt="">
  </figure>
                            
    <p>
      While the operational systems are highly sensitive, model development and experimentation will be performed
      using <strong>publicly accessible GNSS datasets</strong>, allowing us to build, validate, and refine analytics
      in a repeatable and verifiable way.
    </p>

      
      <h3>2. Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>
      A major focus of the project is refining and extending existing algorithms by incorporating
      <strong>machine learning and AI-based approaches</strong>.
    </p>
                            
                                                           <figure class="blog-figure">
    <img src="images/nsic/anomaly.png" alt="">
  </figure>
    <ul>
      <li>Training models on historical GNSS data to learn normal signal behavior</li>
      <li>Detecting deviations that indicate anomalies or degraded signal regions</li>
      <li>Reducing false positives while preserving sensitivity to real threats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These models are designed to scale and, eventually, support near real-time detection and alerting.
    </p>
      
      
       <h3>3. Scaling Big Data Storage and Processing</h3>
    <p>
      GPS data is not small. One part of the project involves identifying efficient strategies for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storing massive, multi-source datasets</li>
      <li>Optimizing processing frequency and latency</li>
      <li>Supporting long-term analytics without sacrificing performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Automation, Visualization, and User Impact</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond raw detection, the project emphasizes usability. I’ll be contributing to efforts that:
    </p>
                                     <figure class="blog-figure">
    <img src="images/nsic/satelitedata.png" alt="">
  </figure>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Automate anomaly identification and event classification</li>
      <li>Improve data visualization and analytic interfaces</li>
      <li>Support future capabilities like emitter localization reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The end goal is actionable intelligence—analytics that operators and analysts can trust and act on.
    </p>
      
         <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      GPS disruptions are not an abstract problem. They can affect military missions, commercial air traffic,
      critical infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and even everyday users relying on navigation apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project Shoelace sits squarely in the domain of <strong>information warfare and national security</strong>,
      but its outcomes also have clear civilian and commercial relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me personally, this project represents hands-on experience applying data science and AI to
      real-world, high-impact systems—working with complex data, real constraints, and problems that matter.
